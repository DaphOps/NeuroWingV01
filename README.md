# NeuroWingV01
 An app for daily tasks for neurodivergent people.

## The idea behind the app
The idea is to make it easier for neurodivergent people to manage their tasks and most importantly, to give them directions to do a task.

### Tasker
In this part of the app, you can create a task for yourself with a priority and a due date. To complete a task, you can use the 'party button' to complete the task. For every completed task, you can get points!

### Explainer
In this part of the app, you can create an Explainer task. This a task with directions. Think about folding clothes. This will then have directions for folding your clothes.

### Planner
